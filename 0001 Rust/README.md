# Programming Rust

Memory-safety, speed of C and functional programming concepts sounds like a dream mix, but this is a good description of Rust. Due to rising popularity and continuos language improvements it is a good candidate to be learned as next thing. Strongly agree with the statement that Rust is a language for next 40 years.

## Goal of the project

1. To learn low-level programming concepts;
2. To learn parallel computing.

## Project resources

1. Carol Nichols, _The Rust Programming Language_ (No Starch Press, 2019)

## Project journey

Rather than sharing my observation in this doc, I will be practising on multiple rust files and write comments there.
