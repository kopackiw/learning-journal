# Learning journal ðŸ““

## Journal's purpose

Nothing motivates and pushes forwards as much as consistency being kept and accumulated. This journal's main goal is to provide a way to persist moments of knowledge gathering as well as be a diary written with personal thoughts.

## Who am I?

At the moment of writing (Jan 2021) my person can be described as (regular) JavaScript engineer. I have more than 2.5 years of experience in the software industry, working both on front- and back-end. Additionally, I am holding a Bachelor in Computer Science.

Somebody may consider Computer Science and Software Engineering as opposite ends of the spectrum. My view is rather dualistic. Practice cannot exist without theoretical basis, as well as theory cannot be established without practical work and experiments. Thus, I want to be impressed by the beauty of mathematics and informatics together with feeling rewarding experience of implementing engineering concepts.

## What do I want to know?

Being aware of perfectionist illusion, I will focus on a broad range of topics, rather than studying them in depth one-by-one. The knowledge of mutual references in the software world appeals to me. Of course, I will have to specialize in the workplace, but it will be a small percentage of overall knowledge a person must have to be successful in this rapidly changing times.

Topics which I would like to know more about:

- Haskell and broadly speaking advanced functional programming concepts
- Software / hardware interface
- Networking
- Domain modelling
- Algorithms (recursive data types)

I am expecting an evolution of my interests over time, so it's more like a little sum-up what's currently on my mind instead of a to-do list.

## Journal entry

It **has not** to be an in depth, three pages long description of what I've done in front of the computer. Rather I would like to keep it systematic and share my thoughts during learning or implementing a new concept.
